		<h2>GOALS</h2>
		<p>I am taking this class to get an idea of whether web development is something I would like to pursue further.  I have always gravitated toward things like building spreadsheets, databases, and operational procedures, and I think that coding could be the next step.  It would be useful at times in my existing job, but I'm also open to the idea of moving out of my current industry completely and into something different.  I'm also interested in the concept of developing Wordpress themes.  I hope that by the end of the next two months I have enough of an idea of what is involved in developing a website that I can make an educated decision about whether to continue taking classes, take a more self-guided approach via online tutorials, or know that this is not for me.</p>

		<h2>CONCERNS</h2>
		<p>I am coming into this class with extremely minimal knowledge.  I canâ€™t honestly say I really understand what JavaScript even is.  Other than a Visual Basic 101 class at PCC about 8 years ago, and creating a few macros in Excel, I know basically nothing about coding.  But I'm a quick learner and I feel like I've picked up a lot in the last week already, so I'm ready for more.</p>
